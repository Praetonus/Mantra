# Mantra

An Entity-Component-System library written in C++. Mantra is fully statically typed and focuses on performance and modularity. The library is also built with multithreading and parallelism in mind. This is not in yet, but stay tuned.

Mantra is still in an early stage of development and things may break. Please open an issue if you encounter any problem.

## Installing

Mantra is a header-only library. You can use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) to install, or copy the library files where you want. Using Mantra in a program requires support of the C++14 standard, as well as the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) libraries.

## Documentation

You can use [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to generate the library documentation.

## License

Mantra is distributed under the terms of the CeCILL-B license (akin to the MIT license). See the LICENSE file or http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html for more information.
